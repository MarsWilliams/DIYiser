This micro webapp is a proof of concept to amuse the staff at DIY. I hope you like it and we can be besties 4 evah and evah.
You can check out the live demo on <a href="https://saltwatersun.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>.

You with me?
-----------------------
You'll need to install node.js to start.

Then clone the project and cd into the directory.

	`$ git clone git@github.com:MarsWilliams/DIYiser.git`
	`$ cd DIYiser`

Install development dependecies with npm.

	`$ npm install`

To start the show:

	`$ node bin/www`

This project looks best viewed in Chrome, but I have also tested it with Safari.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have or help with installation.
